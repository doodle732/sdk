Required knowledge
==================

This guide does not require that you fully understand firmware development or
even Zephyr. We start form a clean repository and we then build on that in steps
until we have a fully configured basic system for writing, checking, documenting
and releasing our firmware.

You need to have:

- **Basic knowledge of C programming** - you should know how to build software
	using a C compiler and how build tools like Make and CMake work.

- **Understanding of Linux** - we do all of our work on linux so linux commands
	are used everywhere throughout this guide. You should be at least a little
	comfortable with Linux and understand how to look up documentation for common
	commands so that you know what we are doing. This guide assumes you have this
	understanding already.
