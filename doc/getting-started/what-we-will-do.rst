Steps this guide covers
=======================

In this guide we will cover the following:

- **Installing the SDK docker image**: so that you can build your first
  application very quickly.

- **Compiling an application for STM32 board**: we will use a sample for this
  and just get it built.

- **Debugging the application in the simulator**: we will start the simulator
  and execute a few simple debugging commands.
